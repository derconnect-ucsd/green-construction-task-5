# Green Construction Task 5

## Git Large File Storage (LFS) Required

This repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage large files (such as test data and signal files). All contributors must have Git LFS installed before cloning, pulling, or pushing to this repository.

### How to Install Git LFS

#### Windows, macOS, Linux
1. Download and install Git LFS from [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2. Run the following command to initialize LFS:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

### Cloning the Repository
When cloning, Git LFS will automatically fetch large files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/derconnect-ucsd/green-construction-task-5.git
```

### Pulling and Pushing
Git LFS will handle large files automatically when you pull or push.

### Troubleshooting
If you see pointer files or cannot access large files, ensure Git LFS is installed and run:
```bash
git lfs pull
```

For more help, see the [Git LFS documentation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial).
